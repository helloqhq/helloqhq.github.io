### The Gist

JSONDiff.com will collect certain non-personally identify information about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.

We will never ask you to provide personal information, will provide no mechanism for you to give us personal information, and will hold no personal information about you.

The ads on our site may also use cookies, but you can remove them or opt out of them and no functionality of the site will be compromised.  You're also welcome to use an AdBlocker and all functionality of the site will still be available.


### Reuse

This document is based upon the [Automattic Privacy Policy](http://automattic.com/privacy/) and is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/). Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!).

### Visitors

Like most website operators, JSONDiff uses ads that collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. JSONDiff's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how JSONDiff's visitors use its website. From time to time, JSONDiff may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

JSONDiff does not collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

JSONDiff does not collect any personally identifying information of any kind.

### Aggregated Statistics

JSONDiff may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Service. For instance, JSONDiff may monitor the most popular parts JSONDIFF.com. JSONDiff may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, JSONDiff does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, JSONDiff may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in JSONDiff's sole discretion. JSONDiff encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
